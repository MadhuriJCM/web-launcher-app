The Web Launcher App is a beginner-friendly Python desktop application that allows users to open commonly used websites through a simple graphical user interface (GUI). Built using Pythonâ€™s built-in `tkinter` module for GUI and `webbrowser` module for opening web pages, this app is lightweight, fast, and easy to use.

## Features

- Clean and minimal user interface using Tkinter
- No external libraries or dependencies required
- Designed with basic Python and OOP principles

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter for GUI
- webbrowser module

## How to Use

Once the application opens, simply click any button to launch the respective website in your default browser.

## Future Improvements

- Add an input field to allow users to enter their own website URLs
- Store frequently used sites using a configuration file
- Allow theme switching (light/dark mode)
- Use images/icons for better UI appearance
- Add error handling for invalid URLs or no internet connection
